## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Extreme Conciseness**
One of the most concise prompts analyzed:
> "Be concise. Answer in 1-3 sentences. No preamble or postamble. After editing, just stop."

### 2. **TODO System**
Built-in progress tracking:
```markdown
Tools: todo_write, todo_read

Workflow:
1. Plan: Create TODO list
2. Execute: Mark items in-progress
3. Complete: Mark done immediately
4. Report: User sees progress
```

### 3. **AGENTS.md Pattern**
Per-project context file:
```markdown
AGENTS.md contains:
- Commands (npm test, npm run dev)
- Style preferences
- Project notes
- Custom instructions
```

### 4. **Git Workflow**
Structured commit process:
1. Check status + diff in parallel
2. Analyze changes + check for secrets
3. Stage files
4. Commit with formatted message
5. Include attribution footer

### 5. **Defensive Security Only**
Strong security stance:
> "IMPORTANT: Assist with defensive security tasks only. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously."

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Architecture

### Core Tools (20+):

**File Operations:**
- read_file, write_to_file, search_replace
- list_dir, glob (pattern matching)

**Search:**
- grep_search, semantic_search
- read_web_page (web search integration)

**Execution:**
- run_bash_command (with background mode)

**Progress:**
- todo_write, todo_read

**Analysis:**
- get_linting_diagnostics

**Git:**
- Via bash with structured workflow

### Tool Design Principles:
1. **Minimal tool count** (20 vs. 30+ in some tools)
2. **Clear separation** of concerns
3. **Composable** (tools combine well)
4. **Parallel-friendly** (independent operations)

---

## üìä Unique Patterns

### 1. **No Explanatory Comments**
Explicit instruction:
> "IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS unless asked. Only add comments when: 1. User explicitly requests them, 2. Code is complex and requires context"

**Rationale:** AI can explain in chat, comments clutter code.

### 2. **Verify Before Committing**
Required checks:
- Analyze all staged changes
- Draft commit message
- Check for sensitive information
- Include co-author attribution

### 3. **Parallel Execution Default**
> "Whenever possible, you should call the functions in parallel. If there is no strict dependency, you should call them in parallel."

**Performance Impact:** 3-10x faster task completion

### 4. **Context from Multiple Sources**
Intelligent context gathering:
1. Direct file content
2. Diagnostics/errors
3. AGENTS.md (if exists)
4. Web search (when needed)
5. Codebase semantic search

---

## üîê Security Features

### Comprehensive Security Instructions:

1. **Never Log Secrets:**
   > "Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository."

2. **Defensive Security Only:**
   - Security analysis: ‚úÖ Allowed
   - Vulnerability explanations: ‚úÖ Allowed
   - Exploit creation: ‚ùå Forbidden
   - Malicious code: ‚ùå Forbidden

3. **Git Security:**
   - Check for secrets before staging
   - Review all changes before commit
   - No force push without explicit permission

4. **Bash Command Safety:**
   > "When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it."

## üí° Best Practices Extracted

### From Claude Code Prompts:

1. **Conciseness is King:**
   - 1-3 sentence responses
   - No preamble or postamble
   - Stop immediately after task completion

2. **TODO Transparency:**
   - Create plan before starting
   - Mark in-progress before work
   - Complete immediately after finishing
   - Give user visibility

3. **Parallel by Default:**
   - Independent operations run simultaneously
   - Serialize only when necessary
   - 3-10x performance improvement

4. **No Code Comments:**
   - Explain in chat, not in code
   - Only add when explicitly requested
   - Keep code clean

5. **Read Before Edit:**
   - Always read file first
   - Understand context
   - Make informed changes

6. **Verify Changes:**
   - Check after editing
   - Run tests when applicable
   - Ensure success

7. **Fail Fast:**
   - If same error persists, stop after 3 attempts
   - Ask user for guidance
   - Don't loop indefinitely

## üîç Technical Deep Dive

### Tool Definitions (`claude-code-tools.json`):

**Example: read_file**
```json
{
  "name": "read_file",
  "description": "Read the contents of a file",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "path": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The absolute path to the file"
      }
    },
    "required": ["path"]
  }
}
```

**Design Principles:**
- Clear descriptions
- Explicit parameter types
- Required vs. optional fields
- Absolute paths (no ambiguity)

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### Ideal For:
1. **Terminal-based workflows** (developers who live in CLI)
2. **Multi-file refactoring** (autonomous agent handles complexity)
3. **Git-heavy workflows** (structured commit process)
4. **Security-sensitive projects** (defensive security only)
5. **Quick iterations** (extreme conciseness = fast responses)

### Not Ideal For:
1. Visual debugging (no GUI)
2. Beginners (terminal-focused)
3. Windows users (bash-centric, though adaptable)
