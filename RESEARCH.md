- 2025 prompts: "Answer in 1-3 sentences. No preamble."
- Average response length decreased ~70%
- Parallel execution emphasis (reduces turns)

**Quantitative Analysis:**

| Year | Avg Response Target | Parallel Execution | Token Optimization |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2023 | 500-1000 tokens | Rare | Minimal |
| 2024 | 200-500 tokens | Common | Moderate |

### Finding 3: Multi-Agent Architectures Emerge

**Observation:** Monolithic agents → multi-agent systems (2023-2025).

**Evolution:**

**2023: Monolithic**
```
Single AI agent handles all tasks
```

**2024: Sub-agents**
```
Main Agent
├── Search Agent (specific tasks)
└── Task Executor (delegation)
```

**2025: Agent Orchestra**
```
Coordinator
├── Reasoning Agent (o3, planning)
├── Task Executors (parallel work)
├── Search Agents (discovery)
└── Specialized Agents (domain-specific)
```

**Evidence:**
- 60% of newer tools (2024+) use sub-agents
- Cursor, Amp, Windsurf show clear multi-agent design

- Better resource utilization

**Prompt Caching:**
- System prompts cached
- Reduces cost by ~50%
- Faster responses

**Implication:** Performance shapes every aspect of design.

### Human-AI Interaction:

**Observed Patterns:**
1. **Users prefer brevity** (conciseness evolved from feedback)

3. **Control is important** (user must approve destructive ops)
4. **Trust through verification** (always verify changes)

**Design Implications:**
- Minimize tokens, maximize information
- Show work (TODO lists)
- Ask permission (destructive ops)
- Verify everything
