## üîç Key Evolution Patterns

### 1. **Prompt Length: From Verbose to Concise**

**2023:**
```markdown
You should provide detailed explanations of what you're doing
and why. Make sure to explain your reasoning thoroughly so
the user understands your thought process. After completing
a task, summarize what you did and explain the changes made.
```

**2025:**
```markdown
Be concise. Answer in 1-3 sentences. No preamble or postamble.
After editing, just stop.
```

**Trend:** üìâ Verbose ‚Üí üìà Terse
**Driver:** Token costs + user preference for speed

---

### 2. **Tool Architecture: Simple to Complex**

**Early (2023):**
```yaml
Tools:
  - read_file
  - write_file
  - search
  - run_command
```

**Modern (2025):**
```yaml
Tools:
  File Ops: read, write, edit, delete, format, glob
  Search: semantic, grep, file_search, codebase_search_agent
  Execution: bash, with background support
  Analysis: diagnostics, linting, typechecking
  Web: search, read_web_page
  Git: via bash with workflows
  Sub-agents: Task, Oracle, specialized agents
  Context: memory, AGENTS.md
  TODO: todo_read, todo_write
  MCP: read_mcp_resource (emerging)
```

**Trend:** 5 tools ‚Üí 20+ tools + sub-agents
**Driver:** More capabilities, better organization

---

### 3. **Code Comments: Encouraged to Forbidden**

**2023:**
```markdown
Add helpful comments to explain your code changes.
Document what you're doing for future maintainers.
```

**2025:**
```markdown
IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ANY COMMENTS unless asked.
Only add comments when:
1. User explicitly requests them
2. Code is complex and requires context
```

**Trend:** Comments encouraged ‚Üí Comments forbidden
**Driver:** AI explanations belong in chat, not code

---

### 4. **Execution Strategy: Serial to Parallel**

**2023:**
```markdown
Use the read_file tool to read the file.
Then use the search tool to find relevant code.
Then use the write_file tool to make changes.
```

**2025:**
```markdown
Default to PARALLEL for all independent work.
Call multiple tools simultaneously. Serialize only
when there is a strict dependency.
```

**Trend:** Sequential ‚Üí Parallel by default
**Driver:** Performance optimization (3-10x faster)

---

### 5. **Context Management: Ad-hoc to Structured**

**Early Approach:**
```markdown
Try to remember what the user has told you.
Keep track of the conversation context.
```

**Modern Approach:**
```markdown
System 1: AGENTS.md file pattern
- Commands, style, structure
- Auto-loaded each session
- User-maintained

System 2: Explicit memory tools
- Memory rating
- Persistent storage
- Strategic recall

System 3: Prompt caching
- Cache system prompts
- Cache common context
- Reduce costs
```

**Trend:** Implicit ‚Üí Explicit + Persistent
**Driver:** Context limits + cost optimization

---

### 6. **Agent Architecture: Monolithic to Modular**

**Early (2023):**
```
Single AI agent handles everything
```

**Mid (2024):**
```
Main agent + occasional sub-agent for specific tasks
```

**Modern (2025):**
```
Agent Orchestra:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Agent (coordination)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task Executors (implementation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Search Agents (discovery)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Oracle/Reasoning Agent (planning)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Specialized Agents (domain-specific)
```

**Trend:** Monolithic ‚Üí Multi-agent systems
**Driver:** Specialization + parallel work

---

### 7. **User Communication: Verbose to Minimal**

**Version History Example (Cursor):**

**v1.0:**
```markdown
Provide helpful explanations along the way.
```

**v1.2:**
```markdown
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
```

**Agent Prompt (latest):**
```markdown
You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines
unless user asks for detail.
```

**CLI Prompt 2025-08-07:**
```markdown
IMPORTANT: Keep your responses short. You MUST answer
concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool
use or code generation).
```

**Trend:** Explanatory ‚Üí Minimal
**Driver:** Efficiency + user feedback

---

### 8. **Error Handling: Permissive to Strict**

**2023:**
```markdown
If you encounter an error, try to work around it.
Keep trying different approaches.
```

**2025:**
```markdown
If same error persists:
- Stop after 3 attempts
- Try alternative approach OR ask user
- NEVER loop indefinitely
```

**Trend:** Keep trying ‚Üí Fail fast + ask
**Driver:** User frustration with loops

---

### 9. **Security: Basic to Comprehensive**

**2023:**
```markdown
Don't include passwords in code.
```

**2025:**
```markdown
NEVER:
- Log API keys, tokens, passwords
- Expose secrets in errors
- Commit secrets to git
- Create malicious code

Defensive security only:
- Security analysis allowed
- Vulnerability explanations allowed
- Exploits FORBIDDEN
```

**Trend:** Simple rules ‚Üí Comprehensive guardrails
**Driver:** Security incidents + enterprise needs

---

### 10. **Git Integration: Basic to Workflow-Aware**

**Early:**
```markdown
You can use git commands if needed.
```

**Modern:**
```markdown
Standard git workflow:
1. Check status + diff in parallel
2. Analyze changes + check for secrets
3. Stage relevant files
4. Commit with formatted message
5. Include attribution footer
6. Verify commit succeeded

NEVER:
- Use interactive git (-i flag)
- Update git config
- Push without permission
```

**Trend:** Basic commands ‚Üí Structured workflows
**Driver:** Quality control + safety

---
